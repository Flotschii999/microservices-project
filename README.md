# microservices-project

This project is the first exercise for the course "Continuous Development and Deployment â€“ DevOps" at Tampere University, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®. The assignment details are provided in the `exercise.pdf` file.

## Disclaimer

All information was sourced from the Docker documentation and my own research. AI assistance was used for implementation purposes, and details of this can be found in the `llm.txt` file.

## Informations

The primary goal of this exercise was to create two different log files in persistent storage, both containing the same content. The first log file is mounted on the user's host system and is accessible by both `service1` and `service2`. The second log file is managed by a custom service called `storage`.

## Rest Endpoints

`localhost:8199/status`

It provides two records, one from each of the main services (`service1` and `service2`). The records should be identical, with only minor differences in the calculation of remaining spaceâ€”these differences should be less than 1 MByte.

---

`localhost:8199/log`

It provides the log file entries generated and managed by the `storage` service.

## Log Files

The log file maintained by the `storage` service is not directly accessible. It can be deleted along with the container by running the following command in the command line.

```
docker compose down --volume  
```

---

The second log file, `vstorage`, is mounted at the containerâ€™s base directory on the host machine. It can be accessed by running the following command from the container host directory:

```
cat ./vstorage
```
